The Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) is a collection of design automation tools and software for quantum computing developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).
Our overarching objective is to provide solutions for design tasks across the entire quantum software stack.
This entails high-level support for end users in realizing their _Applications_ as well as efficient methods for the _Simulation_, _Compilation_, and _Verification_ of quantum circuits.
Reaching towards the hardware level, we also consider _Quantum Error Correction_ tools and _Physical Design_ considerations.
In all these tools we try to utilize _Data Structures and Core Methods_ facilitating the efficient handling of quantum computations.
For a comprehensive visual depiction of the MQT tools, we invite you to download our <a href="_static/flyers/mqt_flyer.pdf" title="Link to MQT flyer">MQT Flyer</a>.
All of the developed tools are available as open source and are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cda-tum).
